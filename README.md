Yudong, WANG is a data scientist at an IoT start-up in Tokyo, Japan. His 
interests lies at the intersection of analytics, statistics and machine 
learning methods in bio-informatics, business, finance and engineering.

He earned a Master of Engineering from 
[Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), where he did 
research about One-Class SVM and published an conference article with 
his Senpai. His master's thesis was titled "Neural Network Based Kernel 
Learning Method for One-Class Support Vector Machine", which was later 
published with title 
[One-class Classification Using Quasi-Linear Support Vector Machine.
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8616117)

He earned a Bachelor of Engineering with GPA 3.83/4.00 from [University of 
Electronic Science and Technology of 
China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Electronic_Science_and_Technology_of_China), 
where he studied computer science, earning several merit base scholarships 
and got to know machine learning.

He is lover of travel, drive and stamp collection. He is good at cooking.
Mapo tofu is his specialty dish :-).
