Yudong, WANG is a data scientist at an IoT start-up in Tokyo, Japan. His 
interests lie at the intersection of analytics, statistics and machine 
learning methods in bioinformatics, business, finance, and engineering.
In his current work, he developed cuffless blood pressure estimation algorithms using a single wearable optical sensor. And he is working on human posture and motion
estimation from a wrist-worn accelerometer.

In his work, he
- Expand self-knowledge to new areas such as anatomy, medical-related, signal processing, time series analysis, and other related research.
- Perform data collection, integration, analysis, and processing.
- Model a wide range of algorithm and machine learning techniques such as regression,
classification, neural networks, etc. 
- Validate model effectiveness according to the experiment objective.
- Provide a JavaScript application to perform as a experiment instructor.
- Review code, refactor and make its standard.
- Support other data scientists on different projects such as providing experience, suggestions, mentoring on the improvement of algorithms performance.

He earned a Master of Engineering from 
[Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), where he did 
research about One-Class SVM and published a conference article with 
his Senpai. His master's thesis was titled "Neural Network-Based Kernel 
Learning Method for One-Class Support Vector Machine", which was later 
published with title 
[One-class Classification Using Quasi-Linear Support Vector Machine.
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8616117)

He earned a Bachelor of Engineering with a GPA of 3.83/4.00 (top 6.4%) from [University of 
Electronic Science and Technology of 
China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Electronic_Science_and_Technology_of_China), 
where he studied computer science, earning several merit base scholarships 
and got to know machine learning.

He is a lover of travel, drive, and stamp collection. He is good at cooking.
Mapo tofu is his specialty dish :-).
